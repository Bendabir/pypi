# GitHub Hosted PyPI

Small implementation of a Python Package Index for some custom packages that are hard to put on PyPI (custom CUDA builds for example). It follows the [Simple Repository API](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/simple-repository-api/#simple-repository-api).

Inspired by : https://github.com/astariul/github-hosted-pypi.
